this is a personal portfolio, originally a bare react/vite app which has now been translated to Next.js

you can start it by running `npm run dev`.

then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site.

some important packages i'm using:

- [Motion](https://motion.dev/) for animations
- [EmailJs](https://www.emailjs.com/) for the contact form
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
